# Smartwyre Developer Test 

- The steps are just build, run the tests and the app for your testing purposes.

One quick note:

On the tests I meant to add logging tests too and the functionality in the app but for time and simplicity I just added some examples on the tests.
For that you can see the test Calculate_LogError_WhenExceptionIsThrown and the LoggerAdapter and ILoggerAdapter implementations that are needed to test logging.


Other than that please reach out for any unexpected issues you may encounter. My email is sehuva.19@gmail.com.


Thanks for the opportunity :)
