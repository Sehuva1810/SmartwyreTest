# Smartwyre Developer Test 

- The steps are just build, run the tests and the app for your testing purposes.

One quick note:

On the tests I meant to add logging tests too and the functionality in the app but for time and simplicity I just added some examples on the tests.
For that you can see the test Calculate_LogError_WhenExceptionIsThrown and the LoggerAdapter and ILoggerAdapter implementations that are needed to test logging.

Also while running the console app you will get prompt for product and rebate names. You can just type "Product1" and "Rebate1" or see the respective classes to see available options for both.

Other than that please reach out for any unexpected issues you may encounter. My email is sehuva.19@gmail.com.


Thanks for the opportunity :)
